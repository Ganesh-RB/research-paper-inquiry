# Research Paper Inquiry
Explore research papers and gain valuable insights with our user-friendly web application. 

## Overview
A web application for exploring research papers and statisticaly analyzing the citation network.

2. Backend: [research-paper-inquiry-backend](https://github.com/ganesh-rb/cique-farm-detection-backend), made with Spring Boot, Java, PostgreSQL, and JDBC.

## Introduction
Citation is a fundamental aspect of research papers, serving as a means to attribute information and acknowledge the original authors. Beyond its primary function, citation has evolved into a metric for measuring the impact of a research paper.

> If your research is cited frequently in other academic literature, it is an indication that your research is making a significant impact.

In this project, we analyze the network of research papers citation. Our objective is to find the top influential papers and authors.

We aim to identify clusters of authors who recurrently cite each other's work, potentially forming what is colloquially known as "clique-farms." This analysis provides a deeper understanding of collaboration patterns within the academic community.

## Data
We use the dataset containing metadata of 629814 research papers. The dataset is provided by [Prof. Manohar Kaul](https://manukaul.github.io/).
<!-- The dataset is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/Cornell-University/arxiv). -->
